/**
 * Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
 * "Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use."

 * - Focuses on splitting large interfaces into smaller, specific ones.
 * - Prevents "fat" interfaces that force classes to implement unnecessary methods.
 * - Helps avoid violations of LSP by not forcing a class to support irrelevant behaviors.

 * Key question ISP asks:
 * “Is this interface too big for what this class needs?”
